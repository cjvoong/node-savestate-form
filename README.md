# Save State Form

Simple project to demonstrate how you can save a forms state locally using JS so a user can come back and fill in the form later and submit it then, rather then start again.

## Local

`docker-compose up mysql`

`npm install`

`node index.js`

Your app then should be available at http://localhost:3000
